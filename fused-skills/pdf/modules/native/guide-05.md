## Fill And Validate AcroForms

Visual review alone is not a correctness check for a fillable PDF. A page `/Widget` annotation can render a value from its appearance stream while the canonical `/AcroForm/Fields` tree is missing or contains a stale value.

1. Keep the result interactive by default; set `flatten=True` only when the user explicitly requests a completed, static form. Preserve the source PDF, and do not flatten a signed PDF without an explicit workflow decision.
2. Inspect both representations before filling: enumerate fields from `reader.get_fields()` and `/Widget` annotations from every page's `/Annots`, following `/Parent` and `/Kids`. If a widget and a canonical field have the same name but are distinct objects with no `/Parent` relationship, do not call `reattach_fields()` blindly: it can create a second top-level field with the same name. Report the ambiguity or produce a static result.
3. Recover genuinely orphaned widgets, fill all pages, and write the result with `pypdf`:

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter
from pypdf.generic import NameObject

reader = PdfReader(input_pdf)
writer = PdfWriter()
writer.clone_document_from_reader(reader)

# Restores widgets that are missing from /AcroForm/Fields.
writer.reattach_fields()
fields = writer.get_fields() or {}
missing = set(expected_values) - set(fields)
if missing:
    raise ValueError(f"Form fields not found after repair: {sorted(missing)}")

values_to_write = dict(expected_values)
if flatten:
    # Paint every existing value before removing every widget.
    values_to_write = {
        name: field.get("/V", "/Off" if field.get("/FT") == "/Btn" else "")
        for name, field in fields.items()
    }
    values_to_write.update(expected_values)

writer.update_page_form_field_values(
    None, values_to_write, auto_regenerate=False, flatten=flatten
)

if flatten:
    # pypdf's flatten=True paints appearances but does not remove widgets.
    writer.remove_annotations(subtypes="/Widget")
    writer.root_object.pop(NameObject("/AcroForm"), None)

with open(output_pdf, "wb") as stream:
    writer.write(stream)
```

4. Reopen the written PDF before delivery. For an interactive result, require every expected field to be present in `get_fields()` with the expected `/V`, enumerate page widgets again, and confirm their effective `/V` (the widget value or inherited `/Parent` value) agrees. Confirm each updated widget has a non-empty `/AP` `/N` appearance and render the final pages to catch stale or clipped appearances. Do not rely on `/NeedAppearances` or a successful PNG render as proof that logical field data was updated.
5. For a flattened result, require zero `/Widget` annotations and no remaining `/AcroForm` field tree after reopening, then render the final pages. Keep an editable copy when the user may need to revise the form.
