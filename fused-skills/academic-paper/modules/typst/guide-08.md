## Output Contract

- Return findings in Typst diff-comment style whenever possible: `// MODULE (Line N) [Severity] [Priority]: Issue ...`
- Report the exact command used and the exit code when a script fails.
- Preserve `@cite`, `<label>`, math blocks, and Typst macros unless the user explicitly asks for source edits.
- For `literature`, diagnose and offer a rewrite blueprint first; only produce revised prose when the user explicitly asks for it.
