## Failure Paths

See `references/failure_paths.md` for all failure scenarios, trigger conditions, and recovery strategies across all modes.

Key failure path summary:

| Failure Scenario | Trigger Condition | Recovery Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------|
| RQ cannot converge | Phase 1 / Layer 1 exceeds multiple rounds while still vague | Provide 3 candidate RQs or suggest lit-review |
| Insufficient literature | bibliography_agent finds < 5 sources | Expand search strategy, alternative keywords |
| Methodology mismatch | RQ type misaligned with method capability | Return to Phase 1, suggest 3 alternative methods |
| Devil's Advocate CRITICAL | Fatal logical flaw discovered | STOP, explain the issue, require correction |
| Ethics BLOCKED | Critical integrity issue (not subject matter) | Stop the user once to confirm; list issues + remediation path; overridable with recorded reasoning |
| Socratic non-convergence | > 10 rounds without convergence | Suggest switching to full mode |
| User abandons mid-process | Explicitly states they don't want to continue | Save progress, provide re-entry path |
| Only Chinese-language literature | English search returns empty | Switch to Chinese academic databases |
