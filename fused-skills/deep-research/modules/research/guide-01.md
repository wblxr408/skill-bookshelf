# Deep Research — Universal Academic Research Agent Team

Universal deep research tool — a domain-agnostic 13-agent team for rigorous academic research on any topic.

**v2.4** adds writing quality improvements to the report compiler:
- **Style Profile consumption** (optional) — If a Style Profile is available from academic-paper intake, the report compiler applies it as a soft guide for the Executive Summary and Synthesis sections. Discipline conventions and report objectivity take priority.
- **Writing Quality Check** — The report compiler runs a writing quality checklist before finalizing: flags AI-typical overused terms, checks sentence/paragraph length variation, removes throat-clearing openers. See `academic-paper/references/writing_quality_check.md`.

> **Routing discipline (v3.9.2):** see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` "Routing Discipline (v3.9.2)" + `shared/references/intent_clarification_protocol.md` for cross-skill routing rules. This skill assumes routing has already settled — ambiguous cross-phase materials should have been clarified upstream.
