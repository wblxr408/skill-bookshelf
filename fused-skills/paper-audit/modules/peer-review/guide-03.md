### Non-Trigger Scenarios

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Need to write a paper (not review) | `academic-paper` |
| Need in-depth investigation of a research topic | `deep-research` |
| Need to revise a paper (already have review comments) | `academic-paper` (revision mode) |

### Quick Mode Selection Guide

| Your Situation | Recommended Mode | Spectrum |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Need comprehensive review (first submission) | full | balanced |
| Checking if revisions addressed comments | re-review | fidelity |
| Quick quality assessment (15 min) | quick | fidelity |
| Focus only on methods/statistics | methodology-focus | fidelity |
| Want to learn by doing (guided review) | guided | originality |
| Want to know this reviewer's own error profile before trusting its scores | calibration | fidelity |

**Spectrum** (v3.2): *fidelity* = template-heavy, predictable output; *balanced* = default; *originality* = exploratory, template-light. See `shared/mode_spectrum.md` for the full cross-skill spectrum table.

Not sure? Use `full` for pre-submission review, `re-review` for post-revision verification. `calibration` is opt-in — run it once per domain when you want to know the reviewer's FNR/FPR before relying on its rubric scores.
